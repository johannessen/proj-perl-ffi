Revision history for Geo::LibProj::FFI

0.0454  2023-11-30

 - Add new PJ_COORD struct member accessors. Instead of calling $c->xyz->x(),
   you can now simply call $c->xyz_x(), which is faster and more likely to
   remain stable with future updates. The old syntax is now discouraged,
   but there are currently no plans to remove it.

 - Deprecate creating PJ_COORD union member structs with new(). Unions are not
   well supported by FFI::Platypus. For best forward compatibility, creating
   new PJ_COORD values should only be done by using proj_coords().

 - Internal change: The PJ_COORD implementation is now based on the vector
   union member. This means the fastest way to access coordinates is now
   via $c->v(...) instead of $c->xyzt->...
