Revision history for Geo::LibProj::FFI

0.0453  2023-11-30

 - Deprecate creating PJ_COORD union member structs with new(). Unions are not
   well supported by FFI::Platypus. For best forward compatibility, creating
   new PJ_COORD values should only be done by using proj_coords().

 - Internal change: The PJ_COORD implementation is now based on the vector
   union member. This means the fastest way to access coordinates is now
   via $c->v(...) instead of $c->xyzt->...
