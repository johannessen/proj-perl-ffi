Revision history for Geo::LibProj::FFI

1.01  2025-02-19

 - Fix segmentation fault on armel and armhf. (GH #4) (Andreas VÃ¶gele)

1.00  2024-05-12

 - Documentation update: Future major changes are no longer expected for this
   module. The version number is incremented to reflect that the interface is
   now considered stable.

 - No functional changes.

0.06  2023-12-05

 - Fix compatibility with Perl v5.26 and older. (GH #3)

0.05  2023-12-01

 - Add new PJ_COORD struct member accessors. Instead of calling $c->xyz->x(),
   you can now simply call $c->xyz_x(), which is faster and more likely to
   remain stable with future updates. The old syntax is now discouraged,
   but there are currently no plans to remove it.

 - Deprecate creating PJ_COORD union member structs with new(). Unions are not
   well supported by FFI::Platypus. For best forward compatibility, creating
   new PJ_COORD values should only be done by using proj_coords().

 - Internal change: The PJ_COORD implementation is now based on the vector
   union member. This means the fastest way to access coordinates is now
   via $c->v(...) instead of $c->xyzt->...

0.04  2021-05-24

 - Add area of interest functions
 - Add distances functions
 - Add error-state manipulation functions
 - Add info functions
 - Add lists functions
 - Add logging functions

0.03  2021-05-21

 - Address performance issues with PJ_COORD values
 - Add brief description of how to work with PJ_COORD values
   and other PROJ data types to the documentation

0.02  2021-03-04

 - Resolve failures reported in CPAN Testers (GH#1 and others)

0.01  2021-03-03

 - Release to CPAN
 - Only a few essential functions are available, just enough
   to support Geo::LibProj::cs2cs and a simple example
